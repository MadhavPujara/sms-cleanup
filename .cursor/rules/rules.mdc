## TypeScript Type Definitions

1. **DO NOT create custom type definition files unless absolutely necessary**
   - Install official type packages (@types/*) instead of creating custom definitions
   - For React Native, always use @types/react-native
   - For other libraries, check for official type definitions before creating custom ones

2. **Type Installation Workflow**
   - When encountering TypeScript errors related to missing types:
     1. First check if official type definitions exist using `npm search @types/package-name`
     2. Install the appropriate @types package with `npm install --save-dev @types/package-name`
     3. Only create custom type definitions as a last resort when official types are not available

3. **When custom type definitions are necessary**
   - Place them in `src/types` directory
   - Name them after the package they're typing (e.g., `custom-package.d.ts`)
   - Keep them minimal and focused on the specific types needed
   - Add a comment explaining why custom types were necessary
